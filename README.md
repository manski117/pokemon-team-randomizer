# Pokmeon Team Randomizer

This is a pokemon team randomizer. It is designed to generate a random team of gen9 legal pokemon and allow the user to export this team to [showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

Currently it is only designed to work with generation 9 (Scarlet and Violet games). Eventually more generations and features will be added.

Updated the readme from a new repo. Does the change show up on the github?

# TODO: 
## Create team slot components
- **DONE**  ~~make sure each slot can randomize individually~~
- **DONE** make sure they are aware of what the other pokemon will be
